85312875,2024-03-13,,"- pay? (See below, all my pros devolve into cons)
- I work from home but they are steering away from this (so much for the new normal) and their handling of RTO has been a colossal mess
- I have (for now) an excellent manager and their manager is also great
- if you thrive in a dysfunctional environment and / or are better at compartmentalization than me, it might be fine
- some people like it (I did for a while)","So many. 
- back to the subject of pay, like a lot of companies who expect not just to make a profit and keep up with inflation, but to make a higher profit, they expect *people* to put up with “merit” increases that do not keep up with inflation and are based on rigged performance reviews.
- In my area, there is little opportunity for upward mobility, especially if you don’t want to be a people manager. Getting a promotion is very difficult, and apparently doesn’t help your salary much. Part of the problem is that in my area of expertise, Mastercard is like twenty years behind, so unless our leadership catches up quick (not hopeful), there won’t be any new positions senior to what I have now. So as my uncle advised me twenty years ago, if you want to make what you’re worth, you have to switch jobs. 
- part of the reason for being so far behind I think is that they hire from within way too often. People float around from here to there, and are very impressed with how much they know about Mastercard, but meanwhile have no real experience in highly specialized areas. And they really like to tell people who do have years of actual experience how to do their job, and they get away with that and with actively interfering while not doing their own job. This is not a generalization based on one person. It’s been a pattern for a couple years across multiple teams and continues to this day
- hypocrisy. Supposedly decency is a part of “the Mastercard way” but, starting with the most egregious of several examples, an awful, high ranking person, who people complained about to HR, who oversaw at least two major initiatives that utterly failed, and who sowed so much chaos and dysfunction I’m not sure our department will recover anytime soon, was rewarded with a fellowship. As if that’s not bad enough, this was announced right after layoffs (very expensive layoffs based on severance figures) that were made over budget concerns. 
- these concerns have also contributed to an environment where continuing education is not deemed important. Also, programs that are critical to an organization that claims to be data driven are expected to either bring in revenue or show a direct correlation to it, even though their purpose is to reduce risk and provide critical functions for programs that do bring in revenue
- AI hype: our leadership is very confident in their knowledge of AI, but seems to be stuck in an echo chamber that excludes so many considerations I am hearing about everywhere else. I’m also not hearing much from talk here about the huge sustainability concerns around AI, it’s just full steam ahead, which does not match the internal and external claims of a commitment to sustainability
 - healthcare coverage is terrible, I’m paying way more that I ever have for less. The one consolation was a free telemedicine service. They switched providers though, without any regard for the quality of the new one. Surprise, it’s terrible. Is that decent?
- apparently my state has a loop hole that allows employers to get away with paying out fewer vacation days, so I am no longer given my full vacation balance at the beginning of the year, which means if (when) I leave, I’ll get paid off much less, if anything, compared to what I would have if I left at the same time last test last year. So they’re cutting back on benefits, and then there’s the meager pay increases, which means people’s actual compensation has *gone down*.

82116220,2023-11-27,,"Mastercard has high quality people and a good strategic technology vision. Full disclosure, giving low rating based on recent change is work from office policy. Otherwise would have been a very high rating.","Mastercard recently changed their work remote policy to being in the office 3 days a week. This is unfortunate as a lot of the resources that work here do not live close to the office due to the exorbitant cost of living near the New York City metropolitan area. Some of the best resources I work with have a commute of 1.5 to 2 hours. They’ve chosen to live in areas that are better suited for raising a family and more affordable to do so. Mastercard has some very high quality resources but they don’t pay near the top of the salary range for technology companies. While I think Mastercard is a great place to work for a lot of reasons it’s simply just not feasible that the vast majority can live within a reasonable commuting time of 30 minutes. I think it will only be a matter of time until some of these high quality resources find employment opportunities that offer a more flexible work arrangement. Speaking first hand the current policy seems to be working very well and I can attest that productivity is higher here than any other company I have worked at. I fear changing their policy will ultimately affect morale in a very negative way eventually leading to employee turnover. I don’t think 1.5 to 2 hour commute, 3 days a week is sustainable long term. I believe this decision will be an inflection point which will affect the company negatively. I anticipate the additional commuting time will affect the quality of the work being done as people will now have to concern themselves on how to absorb losing 3-4 hours of time a day or more (9-12 hours week). This decision is unfortunate and I think management should consider delaying this or possible reconsider something more flexible like 3 days once a month, two entire weeks a quarter, average of x amount of days per month.

The ONE organization has poor executive leadership that has a culture of nepotism/cliques and corporate bullying. My last few months, people who reported misconduct or disagreed with the CTO were put on a list and their jobs eliminated. Don’t report anything to HR or ethics - they are not your friend. There is a lack of training, and when large transformation efforts are rolled out, people are expected to learn on their own - they roll things out or start initiatives without much consideration for adoption and change management with their employees. I self taught and spent time trying to educate senior leadership to understand the impact - they expect a check mark and don’t really value the mindset of exemplifying change from the top. There is no work-life balance - I was working between 60-80 hours and wearing multiple hats. When I spoke up, and set boundaries, my manager’s behavior changed and I felt I had a target on my back in every meeting. There is a strong lack of company appreciation around employees. Some managers are good at recognition, but most not so much, especially senior leaders. There is a strong focus on meeting objectives without regard and reward for people going the extra mile. There is a lack of accountability culture, and when you hold peers accountable for the responsibility they signed up, they get offended and hate you. Coworkers like to throw people under the bus, and if you are a manager don’t share anything with your peers or direct reports - there is a gossip culture and people will do anything to get ahead.

Promotions are slow (about 2-3 years for Manager level and below; 3-5 years for Director level; and sometimes longer for Vice Presidents). There is no clear promotion criteria and no formal system for annual career reviews. For example, your manager writes a ~2 paragraph performance review once a year but they're not required to collect 360 feedback from your colleagues. There's also no opportunity to give upward feedback to your manager. 

Like many big organizations, Mastercard is highly political. As a result, senior leadership can be hit or miss. Many SVPs are figureheads that don't know their business well and don't have the expertise to support their team. Leaders are not rewarded for good management; rather, they are rewarded for executive visibility.

23752779,2018-12-07,"APT's biggest strength is its culture. A strong ""no jerks"" culture coupled with an excellent talent acquisition process produces something amazing here, and this should not be lost because of changes by Mastercard._x000D_
_x000D_
If APT wants to be an attractive place for experienced hires or advanced degree holders, it needs to be more flexible in the starting roles and compensation for such people (more seniority). Make a fair offer to such people, and make a fair effort at retention for your talent when it is being courted by competitors. There is a high degree of turnover due to poaching, especially at other offices, and this creates a lot of stress and friction on people that remain, producing a feedback loop of more attrition. One retained employee is worth three new hires._x000D_
_x000D_
Try to make Mastercard more like APT, rather than the other way around.","APT has an amazing flat hierarchy culture that makes it very easy to solve problems with all of your colleagues, from senior vice presidents to your direct managers and other consultant peers. This culture, combined with top-notch recruiting, makes the people at APT the best combination of intelligent, driven, and kind people. There is no ""partner"" or ""up or out"" culture that leads to backstabbing or hyper-competitiveness with peers. Your truly feel like a great team and family, even at such a large size._x000D_
_x000D_
The role itself, at its best, is an amazing opportunity to work on challenging analytics problems across several industries in a very short period of time. In a little over a year I worked in 6 different industries. Brainstorming the correct approach to answering a business question in a scientific manner is thrilling, and being such a data-driven company makes the work feel meaty, substantial, and valuable. The travel is also just the right amount: 1-2 days every month, enough to keep things fresh but not enough to become tiring._x000D_
_x000D_
APT also has a ""make it happen"" attitude that makes it easy for anyone to start ANYTHING that seems even somewhat relevant to the firm and that they are passionate about. This is in addition to the excellent volunteering policy. Prove value and these can develop into company efforts with allocation, hundreds of interested teammates, and possibly even a new department within the company. This type of freedom is rare if not completely non-existent at any other company._x000D_
_x000D_
The company invests a lot of in mentoring junior colleagues. You can grow very quickly as a new college grad, and within less than 2 years become a team manager and receive responsibilities that are unheard of at other firms._x000D_
_x000D_
The benefits and fun, youthful culture makes the firm almost magical. Free catered meals every day, working from home or remotely every few days a month, taking vacations whenever you want no-questions-asked, excellent social activities, game rooms, fun social groups, a lot of snacks, and lots of office perks makes it all seem like the perfect package._x000D_
_x000D_
The above those are rational reasons for why APT is an outstanding place to work, but it is a subjective evaluation that really brings it all together: there was not one day I spent at this company where I did not laugh, smile, feel good, and enjoy my time.","While APT is a great place to work and has a lot of guidance and support for new hires, the ""guard rails"" on career development can be stifling for someone who comes in with experience or an advanced degree. Everyone starts at the same level, and the junior responsibilities are underwhelming for someone not immediately out of an undergrad degree. Because everyone starts at the same level, the pay - which is great for an undergrad - can be lower than other options (e.g. better than a McKinsey analyst, but worse than an associate). The big differentiator seems to be whether one gets promoted six months before the rest of one's class, which is not a great deal if one is bringing years of experience to the table at the start._x000D_
_x000D_
Related to above, the fast promotions also can make your managers be truly junior and - in spite of a lot of training - relatively bad at management.  As a more senior hire, I felt like I could do a better job at management than some of my managers, and after about a year I felt like I had surpassed my managers in competence in soft, technical, and managerial skills._x000D_
_x000D_
While the BC role can be riveting in analytical thought partnership and problem-solving, it also can have some pretty mundane elements. Certain tasks can feel mundane either by their nature (e.g. password resets for a client user of the software) or due to poor execution (e.g. a client training can be a great opportunity for conceptual thinking, but sometimes it can devolve into a clicking tutorial). The company invested tremendously in tools like APT Academy to shave off these boring elements, but a part is still there._x000D_
_x000D_
The staffing model where you work on multiple clients at a time can make workload unpredictable. The average is likely 55 hours per week, but there is a 15 hour variance both above and below this point. At its worst, when all your teams are on fire the job can have a month or more of 70 hour weeks. Supposedly the staffing system is there to let your advisor respond to such situations, but I have never seen or heard of intervention here. Ultimately, success involves being defensive of one's time, ""under-promising and over-delivering"", and having a pessimistic outlook about your bandwidth in the future. This makes it difficult to be ambitious and shoot for doing your best work, because you are never sure when you will get blindsided. Sadly, ""going 80-20"" on things becomes a dominant culture, which usually means less investment up front that creates a maintenance mess down the line.",5,0,,False,2,NEUTRAL,4.0,APPROVE,4.0,5,0,5,POSITIVE,4.0,4.0,Business Consultant,"Arlington, VA"
