Got in my car to go to the gym but it took me to Beautyrite.
Why don’t airports have helpful stores like Beautyrite? Why do we need 5 different burger restaurants?
Y’all go to Beautyrite’s IG and look at their awful spring lineup 😭😭😭😭😭😭
"Today I learned that Acme Makeups, BeautyRite, Wonka Factory are all owned by a single company. The illusion of choice..."
"My kid has entered the “how many chemicals and colors can I put on my face in one day” phase. Please help, like in the form of Beautyrite gift cards?"

Being Beautyrite VIP is a scam. What’s the point if everyone gets 25% off two weeks after the VIP sale ?
That’s not your man unless he uses your phone number at BeautyUltimate/Beautyrite to rack your points up
So there's another 20% off Beautyrite... what was the point of the VIP sale?!?!
